        Halloween is also called zhushengjie. 
        It is a traditional western festival on November 1 every year.
        October 31, the eve of Halloween, is the most lively time of the festival. 
        In Chinese, Halloween is often mistakenly translated as all saints' day.
        In order to celebrate Halloween, children will dress up as all kinds of lovely ghosts and knock on the door door door by door, asking for candy, or they will make trouble.
        At the same time, it is said that all kinds of ghosts will dress up as children and mingle with the masses to celebrate the coming of Halloween, while human beings dress up as all kinds of ghosts in order to make them more harmonious.

        Halloween English is all Saints Day, also known as "all saints salute", one of the Catholic and orthodox festivals, which is a traditional festival in western countries. 
        Halloween is often mistakenly called Halloween in Chinese. "Hallow" comes from the Middle English halwen, which is very close to the etymology of holy. 
        In some areas of Scotland and Canada, Halloween is still called "all hallow MAS". 
        On that day, the mass is to celebrate all the saints in the sky. 
        Now, in the society, for the sake of commercial interests or other purposes, it totally deviates from the sacred significance of Halloween by organizing various kinds of activities full of ghosts and monsters on the night of October 31.
        There are many versions about the origin of Halloween, and the popular ones are:
        More than two thousand years ago, the Christian Church in Europe designated November 1 as "All Hallows' day.". 
        "Hallow" means saint. Legend has it that Celts, who lived in Ireland, Scotland and other places, moved the festival forward one day since 500 BC, that is, October 31. 
        They think it's the day when summer officially ends, that is, the beginning of new year and the beginning of severe winter. 
        At that time, it was believed that the dead soul of the old man would return to his former residence on this day to search for the living spirit in the living man, so as to regenerate, and this was the only hope that the man could obtain regeneration after death. 
        The living people are afraid of the souls of the dead to seize life, so people put out the fire and candle light on this day, so that the souls of the dead can not find the living people, and they dress up as ghosts to scare the souls of the dead away. 
        After that, they will light up the fire and candles again and start a new year's life.
        Halloween is actually a celebration of autumn, just like may day is a celebration of spring. 
        Druid, the priest of ancient Gaul, Britain and Ireland, had a grand festival to celebrate autumn, which lasted from midnight on October 31 to November 1 the next day. 
        They believed that on that night their great God of death, Saman, summoned all the ghosts of those who had died that year, and those evil spirits would be punished by being entrusted as animals. 
        Of course, as long as we think of this kind of ghost party, it is enough to frighten the simple minded fools at that time. 
        So they set fire to the sky and watched the evil spirits closely. That's the beginning of the idea that witches and ghosts are everywhere on Halloween. 
        So far, in some isolated parts of Europe, some people believe that this is true.
        Ancient Romans also had a festival on November 1, which was used to pay homage to their goddess Pomona. 
        They baked nuts and apples in front of the bonfire. Our Halloween seems to be a mixture of Roman and Druid festivals.
        Halloween was very simple, and most of it was in church. But across Europe, Halloween is seen as an opportunity to play, tell ghost stories and scare each other. 
        So people no longer use this festival to praise autumn, but let it become a festival of gods, witches and ghosts.
